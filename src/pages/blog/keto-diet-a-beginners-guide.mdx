The ketogenic diet has become increasingly popular for its impressive weight loss results and potential health benefits. This comprehensive guide will help you understand what keto is, how it works, and how to get started successfully.

## What is the Ketogenic Diet?

The ketogenic diet is a low-carb, high-fat diet that puts your body into a metabolic state called ketosis. In this state, your body becomes incredibly efficient at burning fat for energy instead of carbohydrates.

### The Basic Macronutrient Breakdown

- **Fat:** 70-80% of daily calories
- **Protein:** 20-25% of daily calories
- **Carbohydrates:** 5-10% of daily calories (usually 20-50g net carbs per day)

## How Ketosis Works

When you drastically reduce carbohydrate intake and replace it with fat, your body enters a metabolic state called ketosis. Here's what happens:

1. **Reduced Carb Intake**
   - Your body's glucose stores deplete
   - Insulin levels drop
   - Fat burning increases

2. **Ketone Production**
   - Your liver converts fat into ketones
   - Ketones become the primary energy source
   - Brain and body adapt to using ketones

## Benefits of the Keto Diet
