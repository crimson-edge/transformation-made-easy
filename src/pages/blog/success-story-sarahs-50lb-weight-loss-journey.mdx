My weight loss journey has been nothing short of transformative. After years of struggling with yo-yo dieting and failed attempts at sustainable weight loss, I finally found a combination that worked for me: GLP-1 medication and the ketogenic diet. Here's my story of losing 50 pounds and regaining my health and confidence.

## The Breaking Point

For years, I struggled with my weight, trying every diet and exercise program I could find. Despite initial success with various methods, the weight always came back, often with a few extra pounds. At my heaviest, I weighed 230 pounds, and my health was suffering:
